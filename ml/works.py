def image_to_feature_vector(image_path, size=(28, 28), normalize=True):
    """
    Convert an image to a feature vector.

    Parameters:
    - image_path (str): Path to the image file.
    - size (tuple): Desired size of the image (width, height). Default is (28, 28).
    - normalize (bool): Whether to normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1]. Default is True.

    Returns:
    - numpy.ndarray: Flattened feature vector of the image.
